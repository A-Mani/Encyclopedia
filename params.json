{"name":"Encyclopedia of Proof Systems","tagline":"","body":"Our goal is to produce a concise\r\nencyclopaedia of proof systems. Every entry in this encyclopaedia\r\nfollows a given template and is preferably exactly one page (and no more than two pages) long,\r\ndisplaying the inference rules of the proof system and a few\r\nclarifications and technical or historical remarks.\r\n\r\nThis project is currently coordinated and maintained by [Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo](http://paleo.woltzenlogel.org).\r\n\r\nSubmission Instructions\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nYou must produce two files:\r\n\r\n* A LaTeX source file (e.g. \"SequentCalculus.tex\") following the [template](https://github.com/ProofSystem/Encyclopedia/blob/master//mainmatter/Template.tex). \r\n\r\n* A bibliography (e.g. \"SequentCalculus.bib\") file containing only the bibitems cited in your entry.\r\n\r\nExcept for the file extensions (\".tex\", \".bib\"), both files should have the same name. This common name should also be the same as the unique ID of your entry chosen by you and specified inside your LaTeX source file.\r\n\r\nWhen compiled, your entry should have exactly one page. If your proof system has too many inference rules and does not fit in one page, please [contact the coordinators](mailto:eps-coordinators@googlegroups.com), send him a paper containing your proof system and ask for an exception.\r\n\r\n[Examples of entries](https://github.com/ProofSystem/Encyclopedia/tree/master/mainmatter) can be found in the [current version of the encyclopedia](https://github.com/ProofSystem/Encyclopedia/blob/master/main.pdf?raw=true).\r\nPlease conform to the examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n**If you have a Github account and are familiarised with git**, you should:\r\n\r\n1. [fork the repository](https://github.com/ProofSystem/Encyclopedia/fork) to your own account and clone it to your local machine;\r\n\r\n2. add your \".tex\" file to the [/mainmatter](https://github.com/ProofSystem/Encyclopedia/blob/master/mainmatter) folder;\r\n\r\n3. add your \".bib\" file to the [/bibliographies](https://github.com/ProofSystem/Encyclopedia/blob/master/bibliographies) folder;\r\n\r\n4. link your \".tex\" file to the rest of the encyclopedia by writing an ```\\includeProofSystem``` statement in the [proofsystems.tex](https://github.com/ProofSystem/Encyclopedia/blob/master/proofsystems.tex) file;\r\n\r\n5. link your \".bib\" file to the rest of the encyclopedia by writing an ```\\addbibresource``` statement in the [bibliographies.sty](https://github.com/ProofSystem/Encyclopedia/blob/master/bibliographies.sty) file;\r\n\r\n6. compile (see instructions below) and check that everything is fine (e.g. no overfull hboxes);\r\n\r\n7. commit your changes and push them to your forked repository;\r\n\r\n8. Make a *pull request* of your changes. (The coordinator will then merge your changes back into this repository); \r\n\r\n\r\n**If you do not know how to use git and Github**, you may instead:\r\n\r\n1. [download the encyclopedia](https://github.com/ProofSystem/Encyclopedia/zipball/master)\r\n\r\n2. add your \".tex\" file to the [/mainmatter](https://github.com/ProofSystem/Encyclopedia/blob/master/mainmatter) folder;\r\n\r\n3. add your \".bib\" file to the [/bibliographies](https://github.com/ProofSystem/Encyclopedia/blob/master/bibliographies) folder;\r\n\r\n4. link your \".tex\" file to the rest of the encyclopedia by writing an ```\\includeProofSystem``` statement in the [proofsystems.tex](https://github.com/ProofSystem/Encyclopedia/blob/master/proofsystems.tex) file;\r\n\r\n5. link your \".bib\" file to the rest of the encyclopedia by writing an ```\\addbibresource``` statement in the [bibliographies.sty](https://github.com/ProofSystem/Encyclopedia/blob/master/bibliographies.sty) file;\r\n\r\n6. compile (see instructions below) and check that everything is fine (e.g. no overfull hboxes);\r\n\r\n7. [Send to the coordinators](mailto:eps-coordinators@googlegroups.com) your \".tex\" and \".bib\" files. \r\n\r\n\r\nCompilation Instructions\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nTo compile, run:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ make clean\r\n$ make\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will automatically execute *pdflatex* and [biber](http://biblatex-biber.sourceforge.net) for you. \r\n\r\n*biber* is a modern alternative to *bibtex*. When used in conjunction with *biblatex*, it is more convenient for handling multiple bibliographies. It comes pre-installed in most modern distributions of *LaTeX*. If your *LaTeX* distribution is too old, it might not contain *biber* and you might see error messages. In this case, the easiest solution is to install a newer LaTeX distribution, such as [TeX-Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) or [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/).\r\n\r\nIf you face any difficulties to compile, [contact the coordinators](mailto:eps-coordinators@googlegroups.com).\r\n\r\n\r\nCriteria for Acceptance\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\n1. the proof system must have been published in journals or conference proceedings.\r\n\r\n2. the entry should be factually and historically correct.\r\n\r\nIf you are planning to submit an entry about a proof system invented by somebody else, we advise you to seek his/her permission first.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeer-Reviewing\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nAll entries are reviewed by the [coordinators](mailto:eps-coordinators@googlegroups.com).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, peer-reviewing is open: everyone is encouraged to review entries within his/her domain of expertise. If you have improvement suggestions for an existing entry, please contact the authors of the entry directly, including the [coordinators](mailto:eps-coordinators@googlegroups.com) in \"cc:\". Your peer-reviewing will be acknowledged. Moreover, if your suggestions lead to a substantial modification of the entry, the coordinators will ensure co-authorship of the entry for you.\r\n\r\nWe kindly ask (but do not require) all entry authors to review a few entries authored by others.\r\n\r\nAnonymous peer-reviewing is also allowed. You may send your suggestions to the [coordinators](mailto:eps-coordinators@googlegroups.com), who will then contact the authors on your behalf.\r\n\r\nTechnical issues related to layout and organization of the encyclopaedia can be reported in the [Repository's Issues Page](https://github.com/ProofSystem/Encyclopedia/issues)\r\n\r\nImportant Dates\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nSubmission to the online repository is currently open. \r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nBy submitting an entry to the encyclopedia, you agree to the following Creative Commons license, and you additionally license your entry for publication as a chapter of the encyclopedia as a book in the future.\r\n\r\n[![License](http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/3.0/88x31.png)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/deed.en_US).","google":"UA-1471148-17","note":"Don't delete this file!
