\textbf {Some of the rules given to the system} :\\
To prove $A\land B$, prove $A$ and prove $B$\\
To prove $\forall X P(X)$, take any $X_1$ and prove $P(X_1)$\\
To prove $\exists X P(X)$, search for an $X$ such that $P(X)$\\
To prove $A \Rightarrow B$, assume $A$ and prove $B$ \\
To prove $C$, if $A \lor B$, then prove $A \Rightarrow C \land B \Rightarrow C$\\
Flatten : Replace $P(f(X))$ by $\exists Y(Y:f(X) \land P(Y))$ or by $\forall Y (Y:f(X) \Rightarrow P(Y)$\\
To prove $\neg A$, assume $A$ and search for a contradiction (i.e. prove $false$)
\\
\textbf {Some of the rules automatically built by metarules from  definitions} :\\
If $A \subset B$ and $X \in A$ then $X \in B$\\
If $C:A \cap B$ and $X \in C$, then $X \in A$ \\
If $C : A \cap B$, $X \in A$ and $X \in B$, then $X \in C$
\end{calculus}

\begin{clarifications}
$C:A \cap B$ expresses that $C$ is 
$A \cap B$ which has already been introduced.
Rules are conditional actions. Actions may be defined by packs of rules. 
Metarules builds rules from definitions, lemmas and universal hypotheses. 
\end{clarifications}

\begin{history}
{\sc \Muscadet} \cite{pastre:1989,pastre:1993} is a knowledge-based system.
It uses natural deduction (following the terminology of Bledsoe
 (\cite{bledsoe:71,bledsoe77}), that is natural humanlike methods).
Facts are hypotheses and the conclusion 
of a theorem or a sub-theorem to be proved,
and all sorts of facts which give relevant information
during the proof searching process.
Universal hypotheses are handled as local definitions (no skolemisation). 
\Muscadet worked in set theory, mappings and relations, topology and topological linear spaces, elementary geometry, discrete geometry, cellular automata, and TPTP problems. 
It attended CASC competitions.
\end{history}

\begin{technicalities}
The system is sound but not complete (because of the use of many selective rules heuristics).
It displays proofs easily readable by a human reader.
\end{technicalities}
