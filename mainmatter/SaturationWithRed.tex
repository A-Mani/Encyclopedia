\textbf{Primary Rules}

\[
\infer[\textit{Deduction}]
{N \cup \{C\}}{N & N \models C}
\]
\[
\infer[\textit{Deletion}]
{N}{N \cup \{C\} & C \textrm{~$\mathcal{R}$-redundant w.\,r.\,t.~} N}
\]

\textbf{Derived Rules}

\[
\infer[\textit{Simplification}]
{N \cup M}{N \cup \{C\} & N \cup \{C\} \models M & C \textrm{~$\mathcal{R}$-redundant w.\,r.\,t.~} N \cup M}
\]
\mbox{}\quad is a shorthand for
\[
\infer[\textit{Deletion}]
{N \cup M}{\infer[\textit{Deduction}^+]
           {N \cup \{C\} \cup M}{N \cup \{C\} & N \cup \{C\} \models M}
           & C \textrm{~$\mathcal{R}$-redundant w.\,r.\,t.~} N \cup M}
\]

$N$ and $M$ are finite sets of formulas, $C$ is a formula.

% The following sections ("clarifications", "history", 
% "technicalities") are optional. If you use them, 
% be very concise and objective. Nevertheless, do write full sentences. 
% Try to have at most one paragraph per section, because line breaks 
% do not look nice in a short entry.

\begin{clarifications}
This is a meta-inference system for refutational calculi
that is parameterized by
(1) an entailment relation~$\models$, (2) an inference system $\mathcal{I}$
and (3) a redundancy criterion $\mathcal{R}$ for formulas and inferences,
such that $\mathcal{I}$-inferences are sound w.\,r.\,t.~$\models$,
and such that $\mathcal{I}$-inferences whose conclusion is contained in
$N$ are $\mathcal{R}$-redundant w.\,r.\,t.~$N$.
Note that the \textit{Deduction} rule is not restricted to adding the conclusions
of $\mathcal{I}$-inferences from $N$;
fairness, however, requires that
every $\mathcal{I}$-inference from persisting formulas must become
$\mathcal{R}$-redundant at some point
(for instance, by adding its conclusion).
\end{clarifications}

\begin{history}
In theorem proving calculi with a redundancy concept,
closure under the inference rules can be replaced by
a refined notion of saturation that allows to
alternate between derivation of new formulas and
elimination of irrelevant formulas
(e.\,g., tautologies and subsumed formulas).
The system was introduced by
Bachmair and Gan\-zin\-ger~\cite{BachmairGanzinger1990CTRS}
for superposition~\iref{Superposition};
it can be used for most other super\-posi\-tion-like calculi,
such as constraint superposition~\iref{ConstraintSup},
superposition modulo theories~\iref{CancellativeSup}, or
hierarchic superposition~\iref{HierarchicSup}, with appropriate choices for
\looseness=-1
$\models$, $\mathcal{I}$, and $\mathcal{R}$.

% General Instructions:
% =====================

% The preferred length of an entry is 1 page. 
% Do the best you can to fit your proof system in one page.
%
% If you are finding it hard to fit what you want in one page, remember:
%
%   * Your entry needs to be neither self-contained nor fully understandable
%     (the interested reader may consult the cited full paper for details)
%
%   * If you are describing several proof systems in one entry, 
%     consider splitting your entry.
%
%   * You may reduce the size of your entry by ommitting inference rules
%     that are already described in other entries.
%
%   * Cite parsimoniously (see detailed citation instructions below).
%
% 
% If you do not manage to fit everything in one page, 
% it is acceptable for an entry to have 2 pages.
%
% For aesthetical reasons, it is preferable for an entry to have
% 1 full page or 2 full pages, in order to avoid unused blank space.



% Citation Instructions:
% ======================

% Please cite the original paper where the proof system was defined.
% To do so, you may use the \cite command within 
% one of the optional environments above,
% or use the \nocite command otherwise.

% You may also cite a modern paper or book where the 
% proof system is explained in greater depth or clarity.
% Cite parsimoniously.

% Do not cite related work. Instead, use the "\iref" or "\irefmissing" 
% commands to make an internal reference to another entry, 
% as explained within the "history" environment above.

% You do not need to create the "References" section yourself. 
% This is done automatically.




% Leave an empty line above "\end{entry}".
