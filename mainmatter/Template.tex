% If the calculus has an acronym, define it.
% (e.g. \newcommand{\LK}{\ensuremath{\mathbf{LK}}\xspace})

\calculusName{ToDo}   % The name of the calculus
\calculusAcronym{}    % The acronym if defined above, or empty otherwise. 
\calculusLogic{ToDo}  % Specify the logic (e.g. classical, intuitionistic, ...) for which this calculus is intended.
\calculusType{ToDo}   % Specify the calculus type (e.g. Frege-Hilbert style, tableau, sequent calculus, hypersequent calculus, natural deduction, ...)
\calculusYear{ToDo}   % The year when the calculus was invented.
\calculusAuthor{ToDo} % The name(s) of the author(s) of the calculus.


\entryTitle{ToDo}     % Title of the entry (usually coincides with the name of the calculus).
\entryAuthor{ToDo}    % Your name(s). Separate multiple names with "\and".


% If you wish, use tags to give any other information 
% that might be helpful for classifying and grouping this entry:
% e.g. \tag{Two-Sided Sequents}
% e.g. \tag{Multiset Cedents}
% e.g. \tag{List Cedents}
% You are free to invent your own tags. 
% The Encyclopedia's coordinator will take care of 
% merging semantically similar tags in the future.


\maketitle


% If your files are called "MyProofSystem.tex" and "MyProofSystem.bib", 
% then you should write "\begin{entry}{MyProofSystem}" in the line below
\begin{entry}{ToDo}  

% Define here any newcommands you may need:
% e.g. \newcommand{\necessarily}{\Box}
% e.g. \newcommand{\possibly}{\Diamond}


\begin{calculus}

% Add the inference rules of your proof system here.
% The "proof.sty" and "bussproofs.sty" packages are available.
% If you need any other package, please contact the editor (bruno@logic.at)

ToDo

\end{calculus}

% The following environments ("clarifications", "history", 
% "technicalities") are optional. If you do use them, 
% be very concise and objective.

% \begin{clarifications}
% ToDo: write here short remarks that may help the reader to understand 
% the inference rules of the proof system.
% \end{clarifications}

% \begin{history}
% ToDo: write here short historical remarks about this proof system,
% especially if they relate to other proof systems. 
% Use "\iref{OtherProofSystem}" to refer to another proof system 
% in the Encyclopedia (where "OtherProofSystem" is its ID). 
% Use "\irefmissing{SuggestedIDForOtherProofSystem}" to refer to 
% another proof system that is not yet available in the encyclopedia.
% \end{history}

% \begin{technicalities}
% ToDo: write here remarks about soundness, completeness, decidability...
% \end{technicalities}



% Please cite the original paper where the proof system was defined.
% To do so, you may use the \cite command within 
% one of the optional environments above,
% or use the \nocite command otherwise.

% You may also cite a modern paper or book where the 
% proof system is explained in greater depth or clarity.
% Cite parsimoniously.

% Do not cite related work. Instead, use the "\iref" or "\irefmissing" 
% commands to make an internal reference to another entry, 
% as explained within the "history" environment above.

% You do not need to create the "References" section yourself. 
% This is done automatically.


% Leave an empty line above "\end{entry}".
