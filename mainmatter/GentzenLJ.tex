% The following environments ("clarifications", "history", 
% "technicalities") are optional. If you do use them, 
% be very concise and objective.

\begin{clarifications}
% ToDo: write here short remarks that may help the reader to understand 
% the inference rules of the proof system.
Assuming that $\alpha$ is a variable not contained in $P$, $\Gamma$ or $C$,
$t$ does not contain variables bound in $P$ and $C$ stands for
one formula or the empty set.
\end{clarifications}

\begin{history}
% ToDo: write here short historical remarks about this proof system,
% especially if they relate to other proof systems. 
% Use "\iref{OtherProofSystem}" to refer to another proof system 
% in the Encyclopedia (where "OtherProofSystem" is its ID). 
% Use "\irefmissing{SuggestedIDForOtherProofSystem}" to refer to 
% another proof system that is not yet available in the encyclopedia.
Proposed by Gentzen in \cite{Gentzen1935} by restricting the
succedent of sequents in \irefmissing{SequentCalculusLK} to have at most one
formula. In the original paper, he notes that this restriction is equivalent to
removing the principle of excluded middle from the natural deduction system
\iref{NaturalDeduction} in order to obtain \irefmissing{NJ}.
% NOTE Assuming that Natural Deduction is the classical version.
The cut is admissible in \LJ and this result is known as \emph{Hauptsatz}.
\end{history}

\begin{technicalities}
% ToDo: write here remarks about soundness, completeness, decidability...
Soundness and completeness of \LJ can be proved using a translation of \LJ
derivations into \NJ\irefmissing{NJ}.
Decidability of the propositional fragment and consistency of intuitionistic
logic follows from the cut admissibility in this calculus.
\end{technicalities}



% Please cite the original paper where the proof system was defined.
% To do so, you may use the \cite command within 
% one of the optional environments above,
% or use the \nocite command otherwise.

% You may also cite a modern paper or book where the 
% proof system is explained in greater depth or clarity.
% Cite parsimoniously.

% Do not cite related work. Instead, use the "\iref" or "\irefmissing" 
% commands to make an internal reference to another entry, 
% as explained within the "history" environment above.

% You do not need to create the "References" section yourself. 
% This is done automatically.
