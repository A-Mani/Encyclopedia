\begin{clarifications}
The method of Socratic proofs is a method of transforming questions, but these are based on sequences of two-sided, single-conclusion sequents with sequences of formulas in both cedents. $\Phi$, $\Psi$ are finite (possibly empty) sequences of sequents. $S$, $T$ are finite (possibly empty) sequences of formulas. The semicolon `;' is the concatenation sign for sequences of sequents, whereas `$'$' is the concatenation sign for sequences of formulas. A Socratic proof of sequent `$S \vdash A$' in $\ESTAR$ is a finite sequence of questions guided by the rules of $\ESTAR$, starting with `$? (S \vdash A)$' and ending with a question based on a sequence of basic sequents, where a \textit{basic sequent} is a sequent containing the same formula in both of its cedents or containing a formula and its negation in the antecedent.
\end{clarifications}

\begin{history}
The method has been first presented in \cite{AW:2004}. Calculus $\ESTAR$ is called \textit{erotetic} calculus since it is a calculus of questions (\textit{erotema} means \textit{question} in Greek). Proof-theoretically, it may be viewed as a calculus of hypersequents with `;' understood conjunctively. It is grounded in Inferential Erotetic Logic (cf. \cite{AW:2013}).
\end{history}

\begin{technicalities}
A sequent `$S \vdash A$' has a Socratic proof in $\ESTAR$ iff $A$ is CPL-entailed by the set of terms of $S$. The rules are invertible.
\end{technicalities}

% General Instructions:
% =====================

% The preferred length of an entry is 1 page. 
% Do the best you can to fit your proof system in one page.
%
% If you are finding it hard to fit what you want in one page, remember:
%
%   * Your entry needs to be neither self-contained nor fully understandable
%     (the interested reader may consult the cited full paper for details)
%
%   * If you are describing several proof systems in one entry, 
%     consider splitting your entry.
%
%   * You may reduce the size of your entry by ommitting inference rules
%     that are already described in other entries.
%
%   * Cite parsimoniously (see detailed citation instructions below).
%
% 
% If you do not manage to fit everything in one page, 
% it is acceptable for an entry to have 2 pages.
%
% For aesthetical reasons, it is preferable for an entry to have
% 1 full page or 2 full pages, in order to avoid unused blank space.



% Citation Instructions:
% ======================

% Please cite the original paper where the proof system was defined.
% To do so, you may use the \cite command within 
% one of the optional environments above,
% or use the \nocite command otherwise.

% You may also cite a modern paper or book where the 
% proof system is explained in greater depth or clarity.
% Cite parsimoniously.

% Do not cite related work. Instead, use the "\iref" or "\irefmissing" 
% commands to make an internal reference to another entry, 
% as explained within the "history" environment above.

% You do not need to create the "References" section yourself. 
% This is done automatically.




% Leave an empty line above "\end{entry}".
