$A_1,\dots,A_n,B_1,\dots,B_m$ are unifiable with most general unifier $\sigma$.

\begin{clarifications}
Resolution is a refutational saturation calculus for
first-order clauses (disjunctions of possibly negated atoms).
It works on a set $N$ of clauses that is saturated
by successively computing \textit{Resolution} inferences
with premises in $N$ and adding the conclusion of the inference to $N$,
until the empty clause (i.\,e., false) is derived.
\end{clarifications}

\begin{history}
The ground version of the \textit{Resolution} rule appeared already
as ``Rule for Eliminating Atomic Formulas'' in
\cite{DavisPutnam1960JACM}.
To refute a set of non-ground clauses,
the rule was combined with a na{\"i}ve enumeration of ground instances.
Robinson's fundamental achievement~\cite{Robinson1965JACM}
was to extend the inference rule
to non-ground clauses in such a way that
the computation of useful instances became a by-product of the rule
application.
It was later detected that resolution can also be described
as the dual form of a special case of Maslov's
\textit{inverse method}~\cite{Maslov1964,Maslov1971}\irefmissing{Maslov}.

Many refinements of resolution were developed in the sequel,
aiming on the one hand at reducing the number of possible inferences
(e.\,g., using atom orderings~\iref{OrderedRes},
selection functions, set-of-support strategies)
and on the other hand at integrating particular axioms
into the calculus
(e.\,g., the equality axioms, yielding paramodulation~\iref{Paramodulation}).
Note that the factoring step (i.\,e., unification of literals
within the same clause) that is built into Robinson's original
\textit{Resolution} rule is usually given as a separate inference
rule in later publications, e.\,g.,~\iref{Paramodulation}.

\end{history}

\begin{technicalities}
The resolution calculus is refutationally complete for
sets of first-order clauses.

% General Instructions:
% =====================

% The preferred length of an entry is 1 page. 
% Do the best you can to fit your proof system in one page.
%
% If you are finding it hard to fit what you want in one page, remember:
%
%   * Your entry needs to be neither self-contained nor fully understandable
%     (the interested reader may consult the cited full paper for details)
%
%   * If you are describing several proof systems in one entry, 
%     consider splitting your entry.
%
%   * You may reduce the size of your entry by ommitting inference rules
%     that are already described in other entries.
%
%   * Cite parsimoniously (see detailed citation instructions below).
%
% 
% If you do not manage to fit everything in one page, 
% it is acceptable for an entry to have 2 pages.
%
% For aesthetical reasons, it is preferable for an entry to have
% 1 full page or 2 full pages, in order to avoid unused blank space.



% Citation Instructions:
% ======================

% Please cite the original paper where the proof system was defined.
% To do so, you may use the \cite command within 
% one of the optional environments above,
% or use the \nocite command otherwise.

% You may also cite a modern paper or book where the 
% proof system is explained in greater depth or clarity.
% Cite parsimoniously.

% Do not cite related work. Instead, use the "\iref" or "\irefmissing" 
% commands to make an internal reference to another entry, 
% as explained within the "history" environment above.

% You do not need to create the "References" section yourself. 
% This is done automatically.




% Leave an empty line above "\end{entry}".
