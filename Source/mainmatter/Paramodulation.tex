$C,D$ are (possibly empty) equational clauses,
$L,L_1,\dots,L_n$ are literals,
$A,B$ are atoms,
$u,u',v$ are terms;
$u$ and $v$, $A$ and $B$, or $L_1,\dots,L_n$, respectively,
are unifiable with most general unifier~$\sigma$.

% The following sections ("clarifications", "history", 
% "technicalities") are optional. If you use them, 
% be very concise and objective. Nevertheless, do write full sentences. 
% Try to have at most one paragraph per section, because line breaks 
% do not look nice in a short entry.

\begin{clarifications}
Paramodulation is a refutational saturation calculus for
first-order clauses (disjunctions of possibly negated atoms)
with equality (denoted by~$\approx$).
It works on a set $N$ of clauses that is saturated
by successively computing inferences
with premises in $N$ and adding the conclusion of the inference to $N$,
until the empty clause (i.\,e., false) is derived.
\end{clarifications}

\begin{history}
Handling the equality axioms in the resolution calculus~\iref{Resolution}
is impractical due to the huge search space generated in particular
by the transitivity axiom.
The paramodulation calculus
developed by Robinson and Wos~\cite{RobinsonWos1969} extends
resolution by specific inference rules that
render explicit inferences with the equality axioms unnecessary.
The original completeness proof also assumed the
presence of so-called functional-reflexive axioms of the
form
$f(x_1,\dots,x_n) \approx f(x_1,\dots,x_n)$;
this was later shown to be superfluous by Brand~\cite{Brand1975SIAMJC}.
Many refinements were developed in the sequel,
aiming in particular at reducing the number of possible inferences,
see~\iref{Superposition}.

\end{history}

\begin{technicalities}
The paramodulation calculus is refutationally complete for
first-order logic with equality.

% General Instructions:
% =====================

% The preferred length of an entry is 1 page. 
% Do the best you can to fit your proof system in one page.
%
% If you are finding it hard to fit what you want in one page, remember:
%
%   * Your entry needs to be neither self-contained nor fully understandable
%     (the interested reader may consult the cited full paper for details)
%
%   * If you are describing several proof systems in one entry, 
%     consider splitting your entry.
%
%   * You may reduce the size of your entry by ommitting inference rules
%     that are already described in other entries.
%
%   * Cite parsimoniously (see detailed citation instructions below).
%
% 
% If you do not manage to fit everything in one page, 
% it is acceptable for an entry to have 2 pages.
%
% For aesthetical reasons, it is preferable for an entry to have
% 1 full page or 2 full pages, in order to avoid unused blank space.



% Citation Instructions:
% ======================

% Please cite the original paper where the proof system was defined.
% To do so, you may use the \cite command within 
% one of the optional environments above,
% or use the \nocite command otherwise.

% You may also cite a modern paper or book where the 
% proof system is explained in greater depth or clarity.
% Cite parsimoniously.

% Do not cite related work. Instead, use the "\iref" or "\irefmissing" 
% commands to make an internal reference to another entry, 
% as explained within the "history" environment above.

% You do not need to create the "References" section yourself. 
% This is done automatically.




% Leave an empty line above "\end{entry}".
