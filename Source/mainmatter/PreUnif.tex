Where $a\in\Sigma$ or $a\in{\vc x k}$; $b\in\Sigma$; $z$ does not occur in $v$;
$\sigma = [\lambda\vc x k.v/x]$; $t = \lambda\vc x n.b(\overline{y_m(\vc x n)})$;
$s = \lambda\vc x n.x_i(\overline{y_l(\vc x n)})$ for $0<i\leq n$ and $l = \texttt{ty}(x_i)$.
\end{calculus}

 \begin{clarifications}
  $\Sigma$ is the term signature. $\vc o p = \vco o p$. $z,x,\vc x k$ and $y,\vc y m$ are variables.
  $v,\vc v n$ and $u,\vc u n$ are terms.
  $\upair v u$ and $\spair v u$ are unsolved and solved, respectively, pairs of $\lambda$-terms.
  $S$ is a set of such pairs and $\sigma$ is a substitution.
  $\downarrow_\beta$ denotes $\beta$-normalization and $\uparrow_\eta$ denotes $\eta$-expansion.
  $\texttt{ty}(a) = n$ for a symbol $a$ of type $\beta_1\rightarrow\ldots\rightarrow \beta_n\rightarrow \gamma$.
  The set $S$ must originaly contain terms in $\beta$-normalized and $\eta$-expanded form.
   \end{clarifications}


 \begin{history}
   In contrary to the first-order case,
   the question whether higher-order terms are unifiable is
   undecidable already for second-order logic \cite{goldfarb81tcs}.
   The first complete procedure for higher-order unification was given by
   Jensen and Pietrzykowski \cite{jensen76tcs}.
   The use of pre-unifiers, introduced by Huet, enabled the search to
   be less redundant and more efficient.
 \end{history}

\begin{technicalities}
  Huet \cite{huet75tcs} introduced the procedure without assuming
  the axiom of functional extensionality and showed that assuming this axiom
  makes the procedure non-redundant.
  The above set of rules assumes extensionality.
The set $S$ is considered
   pre-solved if it contains only solved or ``flex-flex" pairs where a ``flex" term
   is a term whose head is a free variable.
   The solved pairs in $S'$ are the substitution components \cite{Robinson1965JACM} of a
   pre-unifier of $S$ which can always be extended into a unifier.
  The application of the last two rules is
  a ``don't-know" non-determinism, while the choice of which equation to choose
  is a ``don't-care" non-determinism. Nevertheless, by choosing an appropriate strategy,
   the application of the above rules always terminates on a unifiable set of pairs of terms
   and enumerates (with extensionality) a complete and minimal set of pre-unifiers.
 \end{technicalities}


% General Instructions:
% =====================

% The preferred length of an entry is 1 page.
% Do the best you can to fit your proof system in one page.
%
% If you are finding it hard to fit what you want in one page, remember:
%
%   * Your entry needs to be neither self-contained nor fully understandable
%     (the interested reader may consult the cited full paper for details)
%
%   * If you are describing several proof systems in one entry,
%     consider splitting your entry.
%
%   * You may reduce the size of your entry by ommitting inference rules
%     that are already described in other entries.
%
%   * Cite parsimoniously (see detailed citation instructions below).
%
%
% If you do not manage to fit everything in one page,
% it is acceptable for an entry to have 2 pages.
%
% For aesthetical reasons, it is preferable for an entry to have
% 1 full page or 2 full pages, in order to avoid unused blank space.



% Citation Instructions:
% ======================

% Please cite the original paper where the proof system was defined.
% To do so, you may use the \cite command within
% one of the optional environments above,
% or use the \nocite command otherwise.

% You may also cite a modern paper or book where the
% proof system is explained in greater depth or clarity.
% Cite parsimoniously.

% Do not cite related work. Instead, use the "\iref" or "\irefmissing"
% commands to make an internal reference to another entry,
% as explained within the "history" environment above.
