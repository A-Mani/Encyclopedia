% The following sections ("clarifications", "history", 
% "technicalities") are optional. If you use them, 
% be very concise and objective. Nevertheless, do write full sentences. 
% Try to have at most one paragraph per section, because line breaks 
% do not look nice in a short entry.

\begin{clarifications}
% ToDo: write here short remarks that may help the reader to understand 
% the inference rules of the proof system.
  The $A,B$ are formulae; $\Gamma,\Theta$ are finite (possibly empty)
  sequences of formulae; $x$ is a variable; $A(x)$ is a formula. In
  applications of the rules every sequent $\Gamma \seq \Theta$ can be
  replaced with a \emph{cognate} one, i.e., a sequent
  $\Gamma' \seq \Theta'$ such that the sets of formulae occurring in
  $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ resp.\ $\Theta$ and $\Theta'$ are the same.
\end{clarifications}

\begin{history}
% ToDo: write here short historical remarks about this proof system,
% especially if they relate to other proof systems. 
% Use "\iref{OtherProofSystem}" to refer to another proof system 
% in the Encyclopedia (where "OtherProofSystem" is its ID). 
% Use "\irefmissing{SuggestedIDForOtherProofSystem}" to refer to 
% another proof system that is not yet available in the encyclopedia.
  Kleene's systems introduced in his~1952 monograph were the staple of
  generations of logicians, who learned about sequent calculus from
  his textbooks~\cite{Kleene:1952} and~\cite{Kleene:1967}.
\end{history}

\begin{technicalities}
% ToDo: write here remarks about soundness, completeness, decidability...
  Based on Gentzen's sequent calculus $\LK$~\iref{GentzenLK} (called
  classical $\mathbf{G1}$ in~\cite{Kleene:1952}). Seems to be the
  first system (with~\iref{KleeneG3intuitionistic}) in which
  admissibility of contraction is obtained by copying the principal
  formulae into the premisses (accordingly, this is sometimes called
  \emph{Kleene's Method}). Used together with its single-conclusion
  version for intuitionistic logic~\iref{KleeneG3intuitionistic} to
  uniformly obtain decidability of propositional classical and
  intuitionistic logic via backwards proof search
  in~\cite{Kleene:1952}.
\end{technicalities}


% General Instructions:
% =====================

% The preferred length of an entry is 1 page. 
% Do the best you can to fit your proof system in one page.
%
% If you are finding it hard to fit what you want in one page, remember:
%
%   * Your entry needs to be neither self-contained nor fully understandable
%     (the interested reader may consult the cited full paper for details)
%
%   * If you are describing several proof systems in one entry, 
%     consider splitting your entry.
%
%   * You may reduce the size of your entry by ommitting inference rules
%     that are already described in other entries.
%
%   * Cite parsimoniously (see detailed citation instructions below).
%
% 
% If you do not manage to fit everything in one page, 
% it is acceptable for an entry to have 2 pages.
%
% For aesthetical reasons, it is preferable for an entry to have
% 1 full page or 2 full pages, in order to avoid unused blank space.



% Citation Instructions:
% ======================

% Please cite the original paper where the proof system was defined.
% To do so, you may use the \cite command within 
% one of the optional environments above,
% or use the \nocite command otherwise.

% You may also cite a modern paper or book where the 
% proof system is explained in greater depth or clarity.
% Cite parsimoniously.

% Do not cite related work. Instead, use the "\iref" or "\irefmissing" 
% commands to make an internal reference to another entry, 
% as explained within the "history" environment above.

% You do not need to create the "References" section yourself. 
% This is done automatically.
