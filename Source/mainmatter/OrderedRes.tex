$C,D$ are (possibly empty) clauses,
$L_1,\dots,L_n$ are literals,
$A,B$ are atoms,
$A$ and $B$, or $L_1,\dots,L_n$, respectively,
are unifiable with most general unifier~$\sigma$.

The literals $\neg A$, $B$, and $L_1$ are maximal in the respective premises.

% The following sections ("clarifications", "history",

% be very concise and objective. Nevertheless, do write full sentences. 
% Try to have at most one paragraph per section, because line breaks 
% do not look nice in a short entry.

\begin{clarifications}
Ordered resolution is a refutational saturation calculus for
first-order clauses (disjunctions of possibly negated atoms).
It works on a set $N$ of clauses that is saturated
by successively computing inferences
with premises in $N$ and adding the conclusion of the inference to $N$,
until the empty clause (i.\,e., false) is derived.
\end{clarifications}

\begin{history}
The idea to use a syntactic ordering on literals to restrict
the number of possible inferences was developed independently
by Maslov~\cite{Maslov1964,Maslov1968,Maslov1971}\irefmissing{Maslov}
for the \emph{inverse method} (resolution can be seen
as the dual form of a special case of the inverse method)
and by Kowalski and Hayes~\cite{KowalskiHayes1969} for resolution itself
(the requirements for the ordering differ slightly).

\end{history}

\begin{technicalities}
The ordered resolution calculus is refutationally complete for
sets of first-order clauses.

% General Instructions:
% =====================

% The preferred length of an entry is 1 page. 
% Do the best you can to fit your proof system in one page.
%
% If you are finding it hard to fit what you want in one page, remember:
%
%   * Your entry needs to be neither self-contained nor fully understandable
%     (the interested reader may consult the cited full paper for details)
%
%   * If you are describing several proof systems in one entry, 
%     consider splitting your entry.
%
%   * You may reduce the size of your entry by ommitting inference rules
%     that are already described in other entries.
%
%   * Cite parsimoniously (see detailed citation instructions below).
%
% 
% If you do not manage to fit everything in one page, 
% it is acceptable for an entry to have 2 pages.
%
% For aesthetical reasons, it is preferable for an entry to have
% 1 full page or 2 full pages, in order to avoid unused blank space.



% Citation Instructions:
% ======================

% Please cite the original paper where the proof system was defined.
% To do so, you may use the \cite command within 
% one of the optional environments above,
% or use the \nocite command otherwise.

% You may also cite a modern paper or book where the 
% proof system is explained in greater depth or clarity.
% Cite parsimoniously.

% Do not cite related work. Instead, use the "\iref" or "\irefmissing" 
% commands to make an internal reference to another entry, 
% as explained within the "history" environment above.

% You do not need to create the "References" section yourself. 
% This is done automatically.




% Leave an empty line above "\end{entry}".
